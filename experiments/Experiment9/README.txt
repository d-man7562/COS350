Conclusion: I notice that there is a large difference between most of these array ends except for the ones that are multiples of 8.
For these, I assume that there is less overhead when the computer is given numbers that are easier to work with (powers of 8).
I am assuming that the significant amount of space used otherwise is for storing data as well as padding to prevent memory corruption.
