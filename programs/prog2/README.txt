This program was an overall positive experience for me. I have always been curious about how different compression 
techniques work and diving head first into it made a good challenge.

I can't think of any deviations currently, other than my algorithm can't decompress your encoded file which 
probably means we used different algorithms to encode our text.

I appreciated how this project led me to understanding how low level C programming can really be.
When I learned about bitwise operations in computer organization, I had thought those details would remain abstracted,
considering the rapid advancement of technology. Here we are, using it!
